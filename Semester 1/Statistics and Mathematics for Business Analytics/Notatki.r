# Normal Distribution
 If random selection (no bias) then n = 30 is enough to ALWAYS generate a normal distribution
# Binomial Distribution
 p is determined based on past experience


Test_structure <- In open ended question you will be asked what will happen if n changes from 200 to 300 or if p changes
